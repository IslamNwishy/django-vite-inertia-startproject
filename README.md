# Django + Vite (react) + Inertia Initialize project tool
## Steps
- Clone the project into a directory on your system
- Create a virtual environment and activate it
- Install django-breeze `pip install django-breeze`
- Run `python .\startproject <project name>` with the name of the project you want to initialize

- run `docker compose up` and navigate to `localhost:8000` to see the welcome page

### Optional but recommended
- Delete the startproject directory after the project is initialized
- rename the root directory to your project name (it'll always be the title of the repo otherwise)
